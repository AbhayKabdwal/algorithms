# Contributing

We love pull requests from everyone.

## Get Started  

* First [fork][fork] the repository and then clone it using:

    git clone git@github.com:your-username/algorithms.git  

You may contribute by:
- implementing new algorithms in the repo. Be sure to keep it under
right section (e.g. array, dp, stack, etc). Make a new section for it if
it doesn't fall under any section. Make sure that your implementation works.  
- optimizing or improving the existing algorithms.
- adding a different solution for the problem.
- finding and fixing bugs.
- adding examples to explain the algorithms better.
- adding test cases.
- improving documentation.

## Pull Requests
Push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr].

We will review and may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives.
Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Write clean and understandable code.
* You may also explain the output using a minimal example.
* Write a [good commit message][commit].


## Issues
Submit a [new issue][newissue] if there is an algorithm to add, or if a bug was found in an existing algorithm. Before submitting a new issue please review the [existing issues][issues] to avoid creating duplicates. Also, consider resolving current issues or contributing to the discussion on an issue.
